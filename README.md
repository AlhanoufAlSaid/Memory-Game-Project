## Project overview
* RULES FOR PLAYING "MEMORY"
1. Mix up the cards.
2. Lay them in rows, face down.
3. Turn over any two cards.
4. If the two cards match, show them.
5. If they don't match, turn them back over (hide).

--> Remember what was on each card and where it was.
--> Watch and remember during the other player's turn.
--> The game is over when all the cards have been matched.
--> The player with the most matches wins.
--> You can repeate the game many times.
--> Everyone can play the game Adults and children.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
